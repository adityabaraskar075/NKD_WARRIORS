# Q-SmartPay: The Future of Intelligent Payments for Amazon Pay (HackOn Season 5)

Welcome to the repository for **Q-SmartPay**, our submission for the Amazon HackOn Season 5. Q-SmartPay is a forward-thinking prototype that reimagines the Amazon Pay experience by integrating cutting-edge technologies to deliver unparalleled security, privacy, intelligence, and reliability.

Our platform is designed to seamlessly enhance the existing payment infrastructure with a suite of powerful features that protect users, offer smarter financial choices, and ensure a smooth transaction process, even when offline.

## ‚ú® Key Features

Q-SmartPay introduces a multi-layered approach to smart payments, built on five core pillars:

### 1. üß† AI-Powered Payment Suggestions
At the heart of our smart checkout is a Genkit AI flow that analyzes the user's cart value, merchant type, and available payment methods. It provides real-time, data-driven recommendations for the most beneficial payment option, complete with plausible, context-aware offers (e.g., "Save ‚Çπ250 with 5% instant discount on electronics!"). This helps users maximize savings and rewards effortlessly.

### 2. üõ°Ô∏è FraudGNN Shield: Advanced Fraud Detection
We've moved beyond traditional fraud detection with our Graph Neural Network (GNN) based system, **FraudGNN Shield**. It analyzes the complex relationships between users, merchants, devices, and IP addresses in real-time to identify sophisticated fraud patterns that rule-based systems would miss. The system flags high-risk transactions and provides an AI-summarized explanation of the risk factors, empowering users to make safer decisions.

### 3. üèÜ Transparent Smart Rewards on Blockchain
To build trust and provide tangible value, Q-SmartPay integrates a blockchain-based rewards system on the Polygon network. Eligible transactions are rewarded with QSP tokens through a transparent, auditable, and fast smart contract. This demonstrates a decentralized approach to loyalty programs, ensuring fairness and instant gratification.

### 4. üîí Privacy-Preserving Budgeting with FHE
Financial privacy is paramount. Our platform features a **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** powered budget tracker. Users can set a budget and log transactions securely. All computations (like checking if the budget is exceeded) happen on encrypted data on the server, meaning the raw financial details are never exposed. This is a proof-of-concept for truly private financial analysis.

### 5. üåê Offline Payment Resilience with DAG
Internet connectivity shouldn't be a barrier to commerce. Q-SmartPay features a robust offline payment mode. When a user is offline, payments are queued locally and cryptographically linked in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, ensuring data integrity. Once back online, the queue can be securely synced. The system also handles auto-cancellation of expired (48h+) offline transactions.

### 6. üìä AI Budget Insights
Our budget tracking page helps users visualize their spending habits and leverages a Genkit AI flow to provide intelligent forecasts for the upcoming month's expenditure, helping users stay on top of their finances.
